The computational problems the author presents are grouped into three classes: Class I sorting, searching, and related problems such as selection, merging, and generating permutations; Class 2 numerical problems such as elementary matrix operations, fast Fourier transforms, and some basic linear algebra kernels; and Class 3 problems arising in various application areas, such as graph theory, computational geometry, tree traversals, optimization problems, and the bitcomplexity of computing.},
